# Forest Hub

The Forest Hub enables a user to connect an analog joystick and one or more assistive switches to emulate a USB Mouse or USB Gamepad. The device is comprised of a custom printed circuit board, off-the-shelf electronics, and 3D printed parts. The overall cost of materials is about $75.

## How to Obtain the Device
### 1. Do-it-Yourself (DIY) or Do-it-Together (DIT)

This is an open-source assistive technology, so anyone is free to build it. All of the files and instructions required to build the device are contained within this repository. Refer to the Maker Guide below.

### 2. Request a build of this device

If you would like to obtain a Forest Hub, you may submit a build request through the [MMC Library Page](https://makersmakingchange.com/project/forest-hub/) to have a volunteer maker build the device. As the requestor, you are responsible for reimbursing the maker for the cost of materials and any shipping.

### 3. Build this device for someone else

If you have the skills and equipment to build this device, and would like to donate your time to create the switch for someone who needs it, visit the [MMC Maker Wanted](https://makersmakingchange.com/maker-wanted/) section.


## Build Instructions

### 1. Read through the Maker Guide

The Maker Guide contains all the necessary information to build the device.


### 2. Order the Off-The-Shelf Components

The [Bill of Materials](/Documentation/Forest_Hub_BOM.xlsx) lists all of the parts and components required to build the Open Wobble Switch. The main switch component needs to be ordered online. The rest of the off-the-shelf components are also online or may be available in smaller quantities at your local hardware store or dollar store.


### 3. Print the 3D Printable components

All of the files and individual print files can be in the [/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files](/Build_Files/3D_Printing/) folder.

### 4. Assemble the Forest Hub

Reference the [Maker Guide](/Documentation/Forest_Hub_Assembly_Guide_v1.0.pdf) for the tools and steps required to build each portion.
